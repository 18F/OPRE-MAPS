      # The container copies the source into it when it gets built, so it's at
      # /opre_project by default. However, in development, we would prefer to
      # map local source into the container so changes show up immediately.
      #
      # However, our CI environment uses a remote Docker runner, which does not
      # have access to "local" source. If we map local source to /opre_project
      # in CI, the source that was copied in at build-time will be overriden
      # with an empty directory.
      #
      # To work around this, we'll prepend the value of the CI environment
      # variable to the destination of the map. In most CI environments, this
      # value will be some variation of "true", so instead of replacing the
      # /opre_project directory with an empty directory (because the remote
      # Docker runner doesn't have access to the local source), we'll instead
      # make /trueopre_project (or something similar) an empty directory, which
      # is fine because we don't use that directory for anything. It's just
      # temporary cruft in the CI container.
