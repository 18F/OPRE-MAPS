# 13. Use React for the Frontend

Date: 2022-07-26

## Decision

We will use [React](https://reactjs.org), and the other accompanying parts, to implement the frontend.

## Status

Accepted.  Replaces [6. Front-end tech stack: Start off with server-side rendering](./deprecated/006-start-off-with-server-side-rendering.md).

## Context

The [previous ADR](./deprecated/006-start-off-with-server-side-rendering.md) decided that server side rendering was the way to go.
We have decided to use React because...

- It is more established in the industry than server-sided rendering through Django
- One can get easier access to talent.
- It has more established ways of doing frontend development.
