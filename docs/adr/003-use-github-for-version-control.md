# 3. Services for Version Control

Date: 2021-06-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to use some form of version control to track our coding work.

We know that HHS operates a GitHub organization: [HHS GitHub](https://github.com/hhs)

We don't yet know if this organization is GitHub Enterprise or not.

## Decision

We will use the HHS GitHub organization for OPS version control.

## Consequences

We predict this will ease software development collaboration.
