# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-06-22

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We want to record our architectural decisions so that:

* new team members who join can see why we made the decisions we made
* the team can revise or revisit decisions with more confidence and context

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
