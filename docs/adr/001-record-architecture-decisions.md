# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-06-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to record our architectural decisions so that:

* new team members who join can see why we made the decisions we made
* the team can revise or revisit decisions with more confidence and context

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: [Documenting Architecture Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and more robustly detailed and demonstrated [here](https://adr.github.io).

## Consequences

We predict that using ADRs will improve onboarding for new team members by giving them more context.

We predict that using ADRs will improve how we document decision making and decision changes.

We predict that using ADRs will smooth the path to ATO by providing more documentation about architecture decisions.

We predict that using ADRs will help us improve communication with partners about architecture decisions.
