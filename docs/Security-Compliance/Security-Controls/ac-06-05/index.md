# Access Control
## AC-06 (05) - Privileged Accounts

Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [personnel or roles with a legitimate business need or system security function. Privileged accounts must be restricted on the IT system to a limited number of authorized individuals with a need to perform administrative duties. Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of systems].

### OPS Implementation

OPS System Admins are responsible for granting that access to individuals who require the same access.

This is also partially inherited from cloud.gov and ACF OCIO.
