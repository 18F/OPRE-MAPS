# Audit and Accountability
## AU-09 - Protection of Audit Information

a. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion; and

b. Alert [ACF-defined personnel or roles] upon detection of unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of audit information.

## OPS Implementation

Part (a): OPS audit logs/event history are immutable from OPS users directly and only authorized users can access them. Azure infrastructure audit logs are immutable from human modification and deletion. 

Part (b): This scenario is goverened by and is addressed more thoroughly in the OPS Security Incident Response Plan (SIRP) and is part of the ATO package.
