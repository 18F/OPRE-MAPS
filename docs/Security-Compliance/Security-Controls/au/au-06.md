b. Report findings to [the ACF Incident Response Team]; and

c. Adjust the level of audit record review, analysis, and reporting within the system when there is a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information.

## OPS Implementation

OPS is integrated with ACF Tech's Splunk centralized logging system. We believe ACF Tech will manage, review, analyze, and report on findings based on the telemetry contained in Splunk.
