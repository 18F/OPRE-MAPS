# Audit and Accountability
## AU-06 - Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting

a. Review and analyze system audit records at least monthly for indications of [inappropriate or unusual activity; Assurance that logging is functioning properly; Adherence to logging standards identified in this procedure] and the potential impact of the inappropriate or unusual activity;

b. Report findings to [the ACF Incident Response Team]; and

c. Adjust the level of audit record review, analysis, and reporting within the system when there is a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information.

## OPS Implementation

OPS:<br />
Part (a): OPS is integrated with ACF Tech's Splunk centralized logging system. We believe ACF Tech will use the data in Splunk to manage, review, analyze, and report on findings based on the telemetry contained in Splunk within the specified timeline.

Part (b): ACF Tech Incident Response policies will be followed. The OPS Security Incident Response Plan document addresses this more completely and is part of the OPS ATO package.

Part (c): When there is a change in risk based on credible information, the level of review, analysis, and reporting shall be adjusted.

Azure: For the Azure level implementation please see the attached Azure SSP.
