# Contingency Plan
## CP-4 - Contingency Plan Testing

a. Test the contingency plan for the system [at least every 365 days] using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the plan: [NIST SP 800-34, NIST SP 800-84, and exercises (checklist or table-top exercises)].

b. Review the contingency plan test results; and

c. Initiate corrective actions, if needed.

## OPS Implementation

Part (a): The first Tabletop Exercise will be conducted very soon to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the current CP. Then after, OPS will perform the test exercises annually. 

Part (b): After conducting the CP test exercises, the test results will be reviewed by the OPS CP Team, ISSO, ISSM and other relevant roles. 

Part (c): OPS will document any necessary corrective actions in the CP Test Report and remediate any findings. Also, OPS will make all the necessary changes and updates to the CP in accordance with the findings. Please see POA&M# OPS_CP4.
