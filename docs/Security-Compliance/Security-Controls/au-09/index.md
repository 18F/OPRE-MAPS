## AU-09 - Protection of Audit Information

a. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion; and
b. Alert [ACF-defined personnel or roles] upon detection of unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of audit information.

## OPS Implementation

TODO: Seek cloud.gov partial inheritance and draft language for our own oversight of logs/database records where audit logs are persisted.
