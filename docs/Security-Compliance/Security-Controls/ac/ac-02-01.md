# Access Control
## AC-02 (1) - AUTOMATED ACCOUNT ACTIVITIES

Support the management of system accounts using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms]. TODO: need ACF text

Automated system account management includes using automated mechanisms to create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts; notify account managers when an account is created, enabled, modified, disabled, or removed, or when users are terminated or transferred; monitor system account usage; and report atypical system account usage. Automated mechanisms can include internal system functions and email, telephonic, and text messaging notifications.

### OPS Implementation

The OPS application supports automatic disabling of accounts as described in [AC-2(2)](./ac-02-02.md) and [AC-2(3)](./ac-02-03.md). TODO: OPS also automatically notifies the System Admin(s) via email upon new account creation/provisioning, (re-)enabling, or disabling. TODO: Reports can be generated within OPS of user activities and audit logs.
