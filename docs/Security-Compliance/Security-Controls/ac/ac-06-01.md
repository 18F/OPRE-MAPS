Authorize access for [ACF-defined individuals or roles] to:

(a) [Security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) including, at a minimum:

* Setting/modifying audit logs and auditing behavior;
* Setting/modifying boundary protection system rules;
* Configuring/modifying access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges);
* Setting/modifying authentication parameters; and
* Setting/modifying system configurations and parameters.; and]; and

(b) [Security-relevant information includes filtering rules for routers and firewalls, cryptographic key management details, configurations for security services, and access control lists (ACLs)].

### OPS Implementation

OPS allows users with the System Admin role to enact changes to the assignment of users to an assigned role. Such changes are recorded in immutable audit records.

All activity occurring within the Azure hosting environment is immutably logged for later audit capability.

Implementation details related to hardware and firmware are inherited from Azure and ACF Tech Infrastructure.
