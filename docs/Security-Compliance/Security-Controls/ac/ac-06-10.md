# Access Control
## AC-06 (10) - Prohibit Non-privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions

Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

### OPS Implementation

The built-in user roles and role-based access control within OPS contrains users assigned to those roles to only the application functions those roles permit. Within the OPS environment, if you are not an administrator role, you do not have the ability to create or modify accounts.  This is the only role that can do this. Implementation details related to hardware and firmware are inherited from Azure and ACF Tech Infrastructure. AMS is a moderate-impact approved authentication system. For further details, see the AMS/Azure SSP.
