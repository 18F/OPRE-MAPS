# Access Control
## AC-02 (2) - Automated Temporary and Emergency Account Management

Automatically [Selection: remove; disable] temporary and emergency accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account]. TODO: Need ACF text

Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.

### OPS Implementation

The OPS application itself has no concept of temporary or emergency accounts. OPS relies upon and defers all user authentication to the [HHS AMS](https://ams.hhs.gov/) system.

### Control Origination

Inherited from AMS
