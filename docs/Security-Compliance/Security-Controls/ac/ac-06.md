# Access Control
## AC-06 - Least Privilege

The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.

AC-6 (2) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance: Examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions.

### OPS Implementation

OPS has implemented  the least privilege principal by only allowing individuals who require access to do their job role to access the system. In order to access the OPS application, users must log in using HHS AMS.  Only successfully authenticated and separtely authorized users can access OPS.

AC-6 (2)

Once users are logged in to the application, users can only perform tasks associated to their explicitly allocated role as described in [AC-5, Part (b)](./ac-05.md). New user accounts are established with no privileges upon creation and only User Admins may assign a role(s) to users. The User Admin assigns the least-permissive application role based on the needs and requirements of the specific job function of the user.
