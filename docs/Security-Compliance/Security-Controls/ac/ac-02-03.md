# Access Control
## AC-02 (03) - DISABLE ACCOUNTS

Disable accounts within 60 days when the accounts:<br />
(a) Have expired;<br />
(b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual;<br />
(c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or<br />
(d) Have been inactive for 60 days.

### OPS Implementation

OPS itself relies upon and defers all user account authentication to the [HHS AMS](https://ams.hhs.gov/) system. While AMS accounts can be disabled for a variety of reasons including but not limited to overall account expiration or violation of policies, an OPS User Admin may also disable otherwise-valid AMS user accounts from accessing OPS.

Part (d): OPS automatically disables user accounts that have not logged in after 60 days.
