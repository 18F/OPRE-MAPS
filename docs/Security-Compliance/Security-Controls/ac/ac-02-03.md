## AC-02(03) - DISABLE ACCOUNTS

TODO: What does login.gov provide around disabling inactive accounts? Will we need to build something into our applicationâ€™s authorization model to track inactivity and disable accordingly.

Disable accounts within 60 days when the accounts:
(a) Have expired;
(b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual;
(c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or
(d) Have been inactive for 60 days.

### OPS Implementation

The System Admin reviews the list of OPS application users on a monthly basis and/or when the status of a user is changed to inactive or terminated. Inactive accounts are disabled automatically from the system after 60 days.

TODO: Not Django.

The Django Admin interface tells us when a user last logged in to the OPS Application, so we can determine the last date of a user's activity by checking the user's profile there.
