d. Require a signed interagency agreement or interconnection security agreement (ISA) prior to transmission of information for interconnected systems.

e. Require the connecting organization to have a valid Authority to Operate prior to connection and transmission.

f. Positive source and destination address checking to restrict rogue networks from manipulating the ACF routing tables.

g. Authentication to ensure that routing tables do not become corrupted with false entries.

h. Use network address translation to obfuscate internal network addresses

i. Email data leak prevention to maintain compliance, identify and monitor the safe handling of PII.

j. Firewalls shall limit inbound and outbound network traffic to only that which is necessary to accomplish the ACF mission.

### OPS Implementation

a. Inherited from ACF Tech Infrastructure and Azure

b. TODO: need to discuss. Determine outbound internet posture and document.

c. Not applicable

d. Not applicable

e. Not applicable

f. TODO: Consult with the team on some text for this. not applicable? TODO: screenshot of firewall on the subnet(s)?

g. Access to alter the Azure VNET routing tables is limited to users with high-level administrative access to the Azure environment hosting OPS. This access is granted and maintained by the System Owner.

h. For IPv4 address space, NAT is utilized in the network path between public-facing OPS clients and internal infrastructure components

i. TODO: Consult with the team on some text for this

j. The Azure security technologies in use for OPS are configured only to allow inbound traffic from clients where the destination port matches those of the ports required for valid user connectivity to OPS. TODO: Determine outbound internet posture and document
