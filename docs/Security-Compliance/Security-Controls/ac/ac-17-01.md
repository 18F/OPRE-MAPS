# Access Control
## AC-17 (1) - Remote Access | Monitoring and Control

Employ automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.

### OPS Implementation

At a higher level, authentication to OPS systems and information resources and the GFE using the AMS logging mechanisms is continuously and automatically monitored, recorded, and audited at any time by HHS/ACF Tech. At the OPS level, an logging for user access is enforced and further integrated to the ACF Tech managed Splunk system (See [AU-2](../au/au-02.md) for details) and any remote activity is subject to the OPS System Administrator monitoring and control. See the AMS and/or Azure SSP for further information.
