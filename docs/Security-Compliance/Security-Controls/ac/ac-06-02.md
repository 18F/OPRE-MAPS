# Access Control
## AC-06 (02) - Non-privileged Access for Nonsecurity Functions

Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [the security functions or security-relevant information] use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions

### OPS Implementation

OPS logs transactional user events and data changes made by users.

Not Applicable: Within OPS itself, an individual can only be assigned a specific role required to do their assigned job functions. Additionally, AMS account usernames are uniquely and distinctly based on HHS-allocated email addresses. Thusly, a single user would only ever be allocated a singular AMS account with which to access OPS and perform their required job responsibilities.
