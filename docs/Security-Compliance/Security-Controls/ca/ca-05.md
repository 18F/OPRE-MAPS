# Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring
## CA-05 - Plan of Action and Milestones

a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system to document the planned remediation actions of the organization to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system; and

b. Update existing plan of action and milestones [at least weekly] based on the findings from control assessments, independent audits or reviews, and continuous monitoring activities

## OPS Implementation

Part (a): OPS Plans of action and milestones (POA&M) will be created and maintained by the OPS ISSO using ACF Tech-provided template as part of the Security Assessment. The POA&M will manage any vulnerability findings and other risks that arise during the scans, internal reviews, audits and security control assessments and related audit activities.                                                                                                

Part (b): POA&M list will be reviewed and updated on a weekly basis based on the findings of vulnerability scans, Security Control Assessment and any continuous monitoring activities that are planned to be done.
