# Risk Assessment
## RA-05 - Vulnerability Scannings

a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications [per the frequency defined in the HHS Policy for Vulnerability Management or ACF policy] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported;

b. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:

1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
3. Measuring vulnerability impact;

c. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring;

d. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities [per HHS Standard for Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM) Management and Reporting or ACF policies] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk;

e. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with [ACF-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems; and

f. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.

### OPS Implementation

a. The OPS Configuration Management Plan documents in detail the continual monitoring and scanning porgram for vulnerabilities.  Automated scans are run on every push, pull request, and merge on GitHub.

b. The OPS Configuration Management Plan documents in detail the tools, techniques, and processes involved in vulnerability management.

c. Summaries of the security scan reports and vulnerability information are reviewed in GitHub. TODO:  screenshot of summaries of scan reports.

d. Records of vulnerability remediation are available in GitHub. If vulnerability dependencies found are found by Dependabot or Renovatebot, among others, pull requests are automatically opened. These pull requests are reviewed and remediated as necessary and as described in more detail in the Configuration Management Plan.

e. Information from the scan reports and control assessments are shared with the appropriate security stakeholders and are available for review in GitHub.

f. Vulnerability monitoring tools are described in detail in the OPS Configuration Management Plan.

### Control Origination:

Hybrid with Azure, ACF Tech (AMS), and OPS

HHS/ACF needs to have a documented process for vulnerability scanning with identified roles and responsibilities, incorporating appropriate federal oversight and separation of duties.
