## RA-02 - Security Categorization

a. Categorize the system and information it processes, stores, and transmits;

b. Document the security categorization results, including supporting rationale, in the security plan for the system; and

c. Verify that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews and approves the security categorization decision.

## OPS Implementation

Parts (a-c): OPS has been categorized in accordance with FIPS Pub 199 and NIST SP 800-60 as a Moderate impact system. The categorization was determined by evaluating the type of information that is stored, processed, and transmitted by the system and the potential impact levels associated with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information. The security categorization has been captured and documented on the ACF Tech System Categorization Form as well as the OPS SSP. The security categorization is reviewed and approved by AO or AO designee before being finalized.
