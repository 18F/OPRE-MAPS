## AC-02(2) - Automated Temporary and Emergency Account Management

Automatically [Selection: remove; disable] temporary and emergency accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].

AC-02(2) Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.

### OPS Implementation

The OPS application allows for temporary accounts for users in specific scenarios (i.e. before PIV card issuance). All temporary accounts are automatically disabled after 180 days following their creation.

The OPS application does not utilize emergency accounts.
