# Configuration Management

Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system.

## OPS Implementation

TODO: seek inherited text

Once users are logged in to the application, users can only perform tasks associated to their assigned role as described in [AC-5, Part (b)](../ac/ac-05.md).  Privileged functions can only be performed by System Admins.

Authorized developers/maintainers of OPS are granted only enough permissions in GitHub and Azure to support their specific duties.

### Control Origination

Hybrid with Azure, ACF Tech, and OPS.
