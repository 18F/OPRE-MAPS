## CM-07-(02) - Prevent Program Execution

Prevent program execution in accordance with [ACF-defined policies regarding software program usage and restrictions and, when necessary, rules authorizing the terms and conditions of software program usage].

## OPS Implementation

ACF Tech reviews the OPS Azure environments at least annually to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and disables functions, ports, protocols, and/or services deemed to be unnecessary and/or unsecure within the information system.  Please refer to the [architecture decision record](https://github.com/HHS/OPRE-OPS/tree/main/docs/adr), [security compliance documents](https://github.com/HHS/OPRE-OPS/tree/main/docs/Security-Compliance) for additional implementation information.

The application runtime for OPS is deployed as one more sandboxed application containers. Container permissions are confined by the host operating system which is tuned specifically for operating as a container. The relationship between containers and the host operating system is comprehensively covered in [NIST 800-190](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf). For the purposes of this documentation, a container should be specifically thought of as:

* A filesystem housing executable files and configuration files
* A set of running processes based upon items in the container filesystem

### Control Origination

Prevention of program execution addresses organizational policies, rules of behavior, and/or access agreements that restrict software usage and the terms and conditions imposed by the developer or manufacturer, including software licensing and copyrights. Restrictions include prohibiting auto-execute features, restricting roles allowed to approve program execution, permitting or prohibiting specific software programs, or restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time.
