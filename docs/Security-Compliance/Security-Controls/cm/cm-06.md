a. Establish and document configuration settings for components employed within the system that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements using [Standard Configuration Documents (SCDs)];

b. Implement the configuration settings;

c. Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established configuration settings for [individual components within the information system] based on [explicit operational requirements]; and
