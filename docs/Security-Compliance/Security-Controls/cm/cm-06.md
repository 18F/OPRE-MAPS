# Configuration Management
## CM-6 - Configuration Settings

[Per HHS Minimum Security Configuration Standards for Departmental Operating Systems and Applications, other configuration-related Department memoranda and standards, and any applicable OpDiv policy, the organization:]

a. Establish and document configuration settings for components employed within the system that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements using [Standard Configuration Documents (SCDs)];

b. Implement the configuration settings;

c. Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established configuration settings for [individual components within the information system] based on [explicit operational requirements]; and

d. Monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.

## OPS Implementation

OPS Components are configured for the most secure or restrictive settings feasibly possible while insuring application functionality and stability. Additionally, thes settings are compliant with the HHS Minimum Security Configuration Standards and the ACF Tech baseline security requiremnts. Infrastructure changes are controlled via infrastructure as code (IaC) in our GitHub repositories with the requisite branch protection and change review processes in place for any other aspect of source code. Additionally, the OPS infrastructure as code framework detects when live infrastructure has drifted from the prescribed configuration and re-applies the correct configuration at each application of the IaC.

AMS is a moderate-impact approved authentication and authorization system. For futher details, see the AMS SSP.
