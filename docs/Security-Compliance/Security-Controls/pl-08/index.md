## PL-08 - Security and Privacy Architectures

a. Develop security and privacy architectures for the system that:
1. Describe the requirements and approach to be taken for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information;
2. Describe the requirements and approach to be taken for processing personally identifiable information to minimize privacy risk to individuals;
3. Describe how the architectures are integrated into and support the enterprise architecture; and
4. Describe any assumptions about, and dependencies on, external systems and services;
b. Review and update the architectures [at least every three (3) years] to reflect changes in the enterprise architecture; and
c. Reflect planned architecture changes in security and privacy plans, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), criticality analysis, organizational procedures, and procurements and acquisitions.
d. Ensures that the planned information security architecture is consistent with the Departmentâ€™s enterprise architecture program and is based on the taxonomy of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA).
