# Identification and Authentication
## IA-05-2 - Authenticator Management | Public Key-based Authentication

(a) For public key-based authentication:

(1) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and<br />
(2) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and

(b) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:

(1) Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status information; and<br />
(2) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation."

## OPS Implementation

TODO: seek hybrid inheritance from cloud.gov, if any

Public-key based authentication is not used for authenticating to OPS itself.
