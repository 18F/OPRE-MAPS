# Estimation

As a team, we will use points to estimate our issues so that we can better plan our scope for each cycle and our overall roadmap.

## How we'll estimate

We will use points for estimation, with an exponential scale: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

Reference points for what each level means, via [@amymok](https://github.com/18F/OPRE-Unicorn/issues/77):

Points | Meaning
---|---
1 | Really trivial. Typos, word changes.
2 | Easy to change. No need to do additional research. Requires a bit more effort than a trivial task. Examples: Fix a linter error. Fix a single unit test. Reword paragraphs. 
4 | Requires more effort. A medium task. May some research on reminding yourself how to do a task, but no unknowns.
8 | Requires a lot of effort. There may be 1 unknown to research more about. May want to think about breaking this up into a few smaller tasks.
16 | Involves several unknowns. Too big to even talk about at this point. Need to break into smaller tasks.
32 | Involves many unknowns. Too big to even talk about at this point. Need to break into smaller tasks.
