# Reviews Process for Issues

As a team we will use labels for tracking which reviews are assigned to whom and issue comments to tag our teammates when an issue is ready for their review.

## Process

- At least one developer and one PM as reviewers on an issue
- When an issue is ready for review, move to "In Review"
- Add `____ Review` label for those who need to review and also comment, "@" tagging them on the issue stating that it's ready for their review
  - If the issue has a corresponding PR, also assign those who need to review the PR as "Reviewers" on the PR
  - If reviews need to happen sequentially, add just the label for the first review, then when the first review is done, remove the first and add second label and so on

Tip: to see all open issues with your "Review" label go to: [this link](https://github.com/18F/OPRE-Unicorn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and  select the "Labels" dropdown and click the label that corresponds with your name. You can save this search as a bookmark for one-click access to what issues need your review.
